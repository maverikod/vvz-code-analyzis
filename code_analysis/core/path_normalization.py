    Normalize file path and determine project information.

    This is the unified method for path normalization. It:
    1. Normalizes the path to absolute
    2. Finds the project root containing the file
    3. Validates project_id from projectid file
    4. Returns normalized path with project information

    Args:
        file_path: File path to normalize (can be relative or absolute)
        watch_dirs: Optional list of watched directories for project discovery.
                   If not provided and project_root is None, will try to find
                   project from file path alone.
        project_root: Optional project root path. If provided, will use this
                     instead of discovering from watch_dirs.

    Returns:
