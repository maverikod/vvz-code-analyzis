Transmission package for BHLFF framework.

This package provides transmission line theory components including ABCD
matrices and impedance calculations.

Physical Meaning:
    Transmission components implement transmission line theory for analyzing
    wave propagation and impedance characteristics in the 7D phase field
    system.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Implements ABCD matrix formalism and impedance calculations for
    transmission line analysis in the context of phase field theory.
