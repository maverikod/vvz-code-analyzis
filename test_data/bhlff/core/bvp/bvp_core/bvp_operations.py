BVP core operations module.

This module implements the core operations of the BVP framework,
including envelope solving, quench detection, and impedance computation.

Physical Meaning:
    Implements the fundamental operations of the BVP framework that
    work with the envelope modulations and beatings of the high-frequency
    carrier field, including solving, analysis, and characterization.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Provides operations for:
    - Solving the envelope equation: ∇·(κ(|a|)∇a) + k₀²χ(|a|)a = s(x)
    - Detecting quench events at local thresholds
    - Computing impedance and admittance characteristics

Example:
    >>> operations = BVPCoreOperations(domain, config)
    >>> envelope = operations.solve_envelope(source)
    >>> quenches = operations.detect_quenches(envelope)
