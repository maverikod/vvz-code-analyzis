## Purpose (Предназначение)

The list_cst_blocks command lists logical blocks (functions, classes, methods) in a Python file with stable IDs and exact line ranges. These blocks can be used with compose_cst_module for safe refactoring operations.

Operation flow:
1. Validates root_dir exists and is a directory
2. Resolves file_path (absolute or relative to root_dir)
3. Validates file is a .py file
4. Validates file exists
5. Reads file source code
6. Parses source using LibCST
7. Extracts logical blocks (functions, classes, methods)
8. Generates stable block IDs for each block
9. Returns list of blocks with metadata

Logical Blocks:
- Top-level functions: Functions defined at module level
- Top-level classes: Classes defined at module level
- Class methods: Methods defined inside classes (qualified name: ClassName.method)
- Blocks are identified by their logical structure, not just syntax

Block ID Format:
- Format: `kind:qualname:start_line-end_line`
- Example: `function:process_data:10-25`
- Example: `class:MyClass:30-100`
- Example: `method:MyClass.process:45-60`
- Stable enough for edit workflows (if code moves, refresh via list_cst_blocks)

Block Information:
- id: Stable block identifier (use with compose_cst_module)
- kind: Block type (function, class, method)
- qualname: Qualified name (function name, class name, or ClassName.method)
- start_line: Starting line number (1-based)
- end_line: Ending line number (1-based, inclusive)

Use cases:
- Discover code structure before refactoring
- Get stable IDs for compose_cst_module operations
- Find functions, classes, and methods in a file
- Understand file organization
- Prepare for safe code modifications

Typical Workflow:
1. Run list_cst_blocks to discover blocks
2. Pick block_id from results
3. Use compose_cst_module with selector kind='block_id'
4. Preview diff and compile result
5. Apply changes if satisfied

Important notes:
- Only lists logical blocks (functions, classes, methods)
- Block IDs are stable but refresh if code structure changes
- Line numbers are 1-based and inclusive
- Methods are listed with qualified names (ClassName.method)
- Nested functions/classes inside methods are not listed separately
- Use query_cst for more granular node discovery

## Arguments (Аргументы)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_id` | string | No | Project ID (UUID4). If provided, root_dir will be resolved from database. Either project_id or root_dir must be provided. |
| `root_dir` | string | No | Project root directory. Required if project_id is not provided. |
| `file_path` | string | **Yes** | Target python file path (relative to project root) |

**Schema:** `additionalProperties: false` — only the parameters above are accepted.

## Returned data (Возвращаемые данные)

All MCP commands return either a **success** result (with `data`) or an **error** result (with `code` and `message`).

### Success

- **Shape:** `SuccessResult` with `data` object.
- `success`: Always True on success
- `file_path`: Path to analyzed file
- `blocks`: List of block dictionaries. Each contains:
- id: Stable block identifier (use with compose_cst_module)
- kind: Block type (function, class, method)
- qualname: Qualified name
- start_line: Starting line number (1-based)
- end_line: Ending line number (1-based, inclusive)

### Error

- **Shape:** `ErrorResult` with `code` and `message`.
- **Possible codes:** INVALID_FILE, FILE_NOT_FOUND, CST_LIST_ERROR (and others).

## Examples

### Correct usage

**List blocks in a Python file**
```json
{
  "root_dir": "/home/user/projects/my_project",
  "file_path": "src/main.py"
}
```

Lists all logical blocks (functions, classes, methods) in main.py with stable IDs and line ranges.

**Discover file structure before refactoring**
```json
{
  "root_dir": ".",
  "file_path": "code_analysis/core/backup_manager.py"
}
```

Lists blocks to understand file structure before using compose_cst_module.

### Incorrect usage

- **INVALID_FILE**: File is not a Python file. Ensure file_path points to a .py file

- **FILE_NOT_FOUND**: File does not exist. Verify file_path is correct and file exists

- **CST_LIST_ERROR**: Error during block listing. 

## Error codes summary

| Code | Description | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `INVALID_FILE` | File is not a Python file | Ensure file_path points to a .py file |
| `FILE_NOT_FOUND` | File does not exist | Verify file_path is correct and file exists |
| `CST_LIST_ERROR` | Error during block listing |  |

## Best practices

- Use list_cst_blocks before compose_cst_module to discover blocks
- Save block IDs for use in compose_cst_module operations
- Refresh block list if file structure changes significantly
- Use block IDs with compose_cst_module selector kind='block_id'
- Check start_line and end_line to understand block boundaries
- Use qualname to identify specific methods (ClassName.method)
- Combine with query_cst for more granular node discovery
- Use this as first step in refactoring workflow
