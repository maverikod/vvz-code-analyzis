Models package for BHLFF framework.

This package provides model implementations for different levels (A-G) of
the 7D phase field theory, including solitons and defects.

Physical Meaning:
    Models implement the specific physics for different levels of the
    7D phase field theory, from basic validation (Level A) to cosmological
    applications (Level G).

Mathematical Foundation:
    Implements mathematical models for each level of the 7D theory,
    including soliton solutions, defect dynamics, and multi-level
    interactions.
