Analysis package for BHLFF framework.

This package provides analysis tools for phase field data including metrics,
envelope analysis, and spectral analysis.

Physical Meaning:
    Analysis components provide tools for extracting physical quantities
    from phase field configurations, including energy metrics, topological
    properties, and spectral characteristics.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Implements various analysis methods including radial averaging, spectral
    analysis, and topological characterization of phase field configurations.
