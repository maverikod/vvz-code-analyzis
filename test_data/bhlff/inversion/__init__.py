Inversion package for BHLFF framework.

This package provides inverse problem solving components including driver
management, forward modeling, and particle inversion.

Physical Meaning:
    Inversion components implement methods for solving inverse problems
    in the 7D phase field theory, including parameter estimation and
    model fitting.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Implements inverse problem algorithms including optimization methods,
    regularization techniques, and parameter estimation for phase field
    models.
