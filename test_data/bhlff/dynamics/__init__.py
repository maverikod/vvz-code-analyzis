Dynamics package for BHLFF framework.

This package provides dynamic components including traps, tracking, and
collision handling for the 7D phase field theory.

Physical Meaning:
    Dynamics components implement the dynamic behavior of phase field
    configurations, including trapping mechanisms, motion tracking, and
    collision dynamics.

Mathematical Foundation:
    Implements dynamic equations and tracking algorithms for phase field
    evolution, including trap dynamics and collision handling.
