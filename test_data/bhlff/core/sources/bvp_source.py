BVP-modulated source implementation.

This module implements BVP-modulated sources for the 7D phase field theory,
representing sources that are modulated by the Base High-Frequency Field.

Physical Meaning:
    BVP-modulated sources represent external excitations that are modulated
    by the high-frequency carrier field, creating envelope modulations
    in the source term.

Mathematical Foundation:
    BVP-modulated sources have the form:
    s(x) = s₀(x) * A(x) * exp(iω₀t)
    where s₀(x) is the base source, A(x) is the envelope, and ω₀ is the
    carrier frequency.

Example:
    >>> source = BVPSource(domain, config)
    >>> source_field = source.generate()
